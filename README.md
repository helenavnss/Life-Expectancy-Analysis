# Life-Expectancy-Analysis

The Global Health Observatory (GHO) under the World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of health status among countries. In this dataset, there are 193 countries from 2000 to 2015. There are various metrics and dimensions in this dataset. Through the analysis of this data, I began a data brief and then went into tableau to begin analyzing and visualizing the data. From there, I made a presentation in efforts to make recommendations to the policy makers of the countries to help increase their country's life expectancy.
